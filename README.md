## üöÄ Quick Start

### Choose Your Solution

| Solution | Best For | Deployment Complexity | Maintenance | Security |
|----------|----------|----------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Option 2: PowerShell** | Most environments | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Easy | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Simple | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High |
| **Option 1: .NET Compiled** | Enterprise scale (10k+ endpoints) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Complex | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Moderate | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High |

**Recommendation**: Start with **Option 2 (PowerShell)** for easier deployment and maintenance.

### Option 2: PowerShell Native (Recommended)

**Why Choose This**:
- ‚úÖ No compilation required
- ‚úÖ Easy to modify and customize
- ‚úÖ Works in Constrained Language Mode
- ‚úÖ Compatible with AppLocker/WDAC
- ‚úÖ Simple GPO-based deployment
- ‚úÖ Native Windows tools only

```bash
cd option2-powershell-native/
# Read the README for detailed instructions
```

**5-Minute Deployment** (for testing):
1. Sign the scripts with your code signing certificate
2. Copy to `C:\ProgramData\InventoryAgent\`
3. Run `Install-InventoryTasks.ps1` as Administrator
4. Verify with `Test-InventoryAgent.ps1`

### Option 1: Compiled .NET Service

**Why Choose This**:
- ‚úÖ Better performance at scale
- ‚úÖ Runs as Windows Service
- ‚úÖ Real-time event monitoring
- ‚úÖ More difficult to tamper with

**Get Started**:
```bash
cd option1-dotnet-compiled/
# Read the README for build and deployment instructions
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Read This Before Deployment

**For Restrictive Security Environments**, you MUST address these requirements:

1. **Code Signing** (REQUIRED):
   - All scripts and executables must be digitally signed
   - See: `shared-documentation/Security-Requirements.md` Section 1

2. **Application Control** (AppLocker/WDAC):
   - Configure policies to allow inventory agent
   - Templates: `security-templates/AppLocker-Rules.xml`
   - Generator: `security-templates/Create-WDACPolicy.ps1`

3. **PowerShell Security**:
   - Execution Policy: RemoteSigned or AllSigned
   - Constrained Language Mode: Fully supported
   - See: Security Requirements Section 3

4. **Antivirus/EDR Exclusions**:
   - Coordinate with security team for required exclusions
   - See: Security Requirements Section 8

5. **Network Security**:
   - Firewall rules for outbound HTTPS
   - Proxy authentication support included
   - See: Security Requirements Section 6

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist

Before deployment, complete the **Pre-Deployment Security Checklist**:

```powershell
# Run the deployment readiness checker
cd deployment-tools/
.\Test-DeploymentReadiness.ps1 -ServerEndpoint "https://inventory.company.com" -Detailed
```

This script checks for:
- ‚úÖ PowerShell version and execution policy
- ‚úÖ Constrained Language Mode compatibility
- ‚úÖ AppLocker/WDAC policies
- ‚úÖ WMI/CIM access permissions
- ‚úÖ Event Log access
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity and proxy configuration
- ‚úÖ Certificate store access
- ‚úÖ Antivirus/EDR status
- ‚úÖ File system permissions
- ‚úÖ Scheduled task capability

.\deployment-tools\Test-DeploymentReadiness.ps1 -ServerEndpoint "https://inventory.company.com" -Detailed -ExportReport
```

**Checks Performed**:
- PowerShell environment (version, execution policy, language mode)
- Application control (AppLocker, WDAC)
- WMI/CIM access
- Event Log permissions
- Network connectivity (DNS, TCP, HTTPS, proxy)
- Certificate store access

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Script cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"

**Cause**: Execution policy restriction

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Check current policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Option 1: Change policy (requires admin)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine

# Option 2: Sign the script (RECOMMENDED)
$Cert = Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My -CodeSigningCert | Select-Object -First 1
Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath ".\Collect-Inventory.ps1" -Certificate $Cert
```

#### Issue: AppLocker blocking script execution

**Cause**: No AppLocker rule allowing the script

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Import provided AppLocker policy
Set-AppLockerPolicy -XMLPolicy ".\security-templates\AppLocker-Rules.xml" -Merge

# Or create custom rule
New-AppLockerPolicy -RuleType Publisher -Path "C:\ProgramData\InventoryAgent\*.ps1" -User Everyone -Action Allow
```

#### Issue: "Constrained Language Mode" warning

**Status**: ‚úÖ Expected and supported

The PowerShell agent is fully compatible with Constrained Language Mode. Compression is automatically disabled.

#### Issue: WMI Access Denied

**Cause**: Agent not running as SYSTEM

**Solution**:
Verify scheduled task runs as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`:
```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "InventoryAgent-*" | ForEach-Object {
    $Info = Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName $_.TaskName
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        TaskName = $_.TaskName
        User = $_.Principal.UserId
        RunLevel = $_.Principal.RunLevel
    }
}
```

#### Issue: Connection timeouts or network errors

**Causes**:
- Firewall blocking outbound HTTPS
- Proxy authentication required
- Server not reachable

**Solutions**:
```powershell
# Test connectivity
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName inventory.company.com -Port 443

# Check proxy settings
netsh winhttp show proxy

# Configure proxy in agent config
$Config = Get-Content "C:\ProgramData\InventoryAgent\Config.json" | ConvertFrom-Json
$Config.UseProxy = $true
$Config.ProxyServer = "http://proxy.company.com:8080"
$Config | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File "C:\ProgramData\InventoryAgent\Config.json"
```

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Monitoring

**Check**:
- Collection success rate
- Network errors
- Security alerts from AV/EDR

**Script**:
```powershell
# Get today's collection statistics
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -ProviderName "InventoryAgent" |
    Where-Object {$_.TimeCreated -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)} |
    Group-Object Id |
    Select-Object Count, @{Name="EventType";Expression={
        switch($_.Name) {
            1000 {"Started"}
            1001 {"Completed"}
            1002 {"Failed"}
            1003 {"Security"}
        }
    }}
```

### Weekly Monitoring

**Check**:
- Code signing certificate expiration
- AppLocker/WDAC policy violations
- Offline queue buildup

### Monthly Maintenance

**Tasks**:
- Review security audit logs
- Check agent version distribution
- Validate data accuracy
- Update documentation
